    "home.funFact": "The Democratic Republic of Congo is home to the world's largest cobalt reserves. Cobalt is a key component in the production of lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles, smartphones, and laptops. The demand for cobalt has skyrocketed in recent years, leading to an increase in child labor and unsafe working conditions in Congolese mines. By boycotting products made with Congolese cobalt, you can help reduce the demand for child labor and promote ethical mining practices.",
